One option is to provide them with appropriate scratching posts or pads, so they can satisfy their scratching instinct in a designated area. You can also try using deterrents like double-sided tape or citrus spray on the furniture to discourage them from scratching. Additionally, you can trim your cat's nails regularly or use soft nail caps to prevent damage to furniture. Finally, positive reinforcement techniques, such as rewarding your cat for using the scratching post, can also be effective in redirecting their behavior.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 110, 'prompt_tokens': 3555, 'total_tokens': 3665, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-64718722-e322-44f9-bc1f-fa66db0711df-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3555, 'output_tokens': 110, 'total_tokens': 3665, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"

just like you who sent it into this address right there which you of course can do as well and today we're gonna talk to Kinesha Kinesha what's it all about hi Jackson I'm Kinesha from the Cayman Islands my husband and I have a cat sunshine she's 11 years old and we've always wanted to get another cat to you know keep her company and also rescue from the human society but you know we're a bit worried because she has been the only cat in the home for so long in 11 years and we just wonder whether or not she'll be very receptive to the addition of another cat in the home we'd love your feedback on the best approach to do so you know what can we do to make this a seamless process because we'd really love for it to be a success and to avoid any elimination or scratching or you know any of the behaviors that are likely to be exhibited if she is unhappy with the addition of the new cat which she has done in the past in some instances when you know we have gone out and left her for too long so I'd really love to hear your thoughts on that thank you all right well first of all Kinesha right on I'm so glad that you're all about rescuing the cats in your area who need homes I mean that goes without saying and of course I want you to do that at the same time we do have to take care of what sunshine's needs are at this point and at 11 years old and from what I understand from what you said she's never been around another cat before you know that's that's something you really just need to consider a couple of things that I noticed in what you sent me was first of all this so clearly sunshine is still playful she likes to be a little mischievous and chase things under the sheets and whatnot and that tells us okay so she still has that get up and go at 11 years old is still let's just be very clear about this where she's technically a senior some cats are just more senior than others and some just retain that playfulness that inquisitiveness and it's important to know who sunshine is before we compliment her with someone that sunshine would like now there are a couple of different ways you can go you can adopt another senior and that believe me not just you Kinesha but everyone you guys seniors need homes so much quicker than other cats because the stress that they go through in rescue environments is multiplied because we know that as cats get older they manifest stress physically a lot quicker than younger cats so yeah man getting seniors out of out of rescue situations is paramount so I would definitely encourage that what I would encourage is a cat that maybe has been around other cats before so the adjustment for the newcomer isn't as bad as it could be and by that cat being somewhat relaxed perhaps sunshine will be as well the second way you can go now folks do this all the time they have older cats they are missing the concept of youthful energy and they go out and they adopt a kitten and they always say the same thing it's for the cat my cat needs a friend and let me tell you something your senior cat does not need a kitten no they do not need a kitten in their life they've got this they're settled they have their territory sort of buttoned down they know what every day is going to bring and all of a sudden Dennis the men is shows up with a slingshot and everything is just shot if you are thinking about bringing a kitten into a home with a cat like sunshine first of all remember something whether it's you Kanisha or anybody else it's for you it's not for sunshine sunshine could get used to it but it's because you want another cat in the house and Kanisha made that clear that this is more about what you guys would like so I like the fact that you're starting from there but I'm telling you this you guys if you're going to adopt a younger cat whether it's a kitten or a teenager anywhere in the first year of life adopt to just bring home to to is always better than one especially when it comes to kittens those guys will entertain each other they will learn the ropes they will play at their speed and sunshine then has that ability to watch them from a distance and figure out what this thing is all about and be able to join when she wants to and walk away when she wants to as well yeah every now and again the kittens will decide that sunshine's tail is the best toy in the whole wide world but you guys can deal with that as long as you let sunshine know that this is her place so she doesn't feel like she needs to claim it away from someone else then that's a great place to start so whether it's two kittens or one senior or anywhere in between I guess it's more about when you meet that cat how do you think they'll match up are you getting a cat who is just really really hyper and sunshine doesn't seem to be or are you getting someone who matches her energy level I think that that's really one of the the best things that you can do now whether again it's a kitten or a teenager or a senior or anywhere in between any cat that you go I think sunshine will be able to cope with this cat then it all comes down to the introduction process and and that to me is the most key element of making a resident cat happy who's not been around other cats her whole life just safe introductions if you check out my book Total Cat Mojo you'll see the entire introduction process laid out in exhaustive detail we've got videos about introducing cats so take a look at my videos there's a few I'll leave them in the description one you want to make sure that you establish a really good base camp for your newcomer so that's one video the second one would be about introducing cats don't skip the steps even if you go quickly through them because sunshine is like yeah none of this matters to me great but you might see that it does matter to her that she smells cats under the door and goes what's going on here and as long as you do it slowly and you don't threaten her well-being you know what you can bring cats into the house it's my belief that cats should be with other cats so whether you bring in a senior kinesha whether you bring in a couple of kittens not one but a couple of kittens there's a really good chance that you can make it work to your satisfaction and to sunshine satisfaction right sunshine right all right you guys keep those questions coming all you got to do is go to this link right down here and it will prompt you to basically do exactly what kinesha did so brilliantly which is to say your name your cat's name what your question is and then some footage of your cat doing anything in this case with sunshine just you know enjoying the Cayman Islands which I think any of us would do and this week's team cat Mojo Rockstar is Batman and now obviously the name Batman got me in the first place but Batman is just an expert fetcher let's take a look his person Lisa knows exactly how to toss it Batman knows exactly how to bring it back and everyone's happy except for this innocent bystander right here there's always the cat in the room was like you guys playing fetch again well I don't understand it this is so boring you throw you bring it back you throw you bring it back and I just have to sit here and watch it all day man anyway Batman's Rockstar and your other cat is great just because they provide such brilliant commentary again for your questions you go to Jackson Galaxy dot com forward slash submit for rock stars you do the exact same thing just make sure you're saying hey my cat's a rock star as opposed to hey I've got a question and then everything falls into place from there all right you guys stay safe out there show some love it doesn't take much and and it makes you feel better and it makes the world go around don't it all right light love and Mojo to you guys take care near\", \" What's up gang is I Jackson Galaxy your cat daddy and today your cat question answerer that is what I'm here for today hopefully we get

I said, why don't we shoot it to the screen right now? Oh my god. Okay, so the first thing is, why did you let it happen? You know, if you see your cat staring down like that, that is a bad thing. That's like two cats holding guns staring at each other and telling the other one to drop a gun. It's 50-50 that they're going to walk away or they're not going to walk away. In those moments of freeze, stop it. Put something in between them. Make sure it doesn't start. And then if you know these two cats are fighting, separate them because there's no good that comes out. That was like six cats in there. So there's a lot of stuff that you can do to prevent fights from happening. And I've got plenty of videos on that. But in the meantime, if these cats keep fighting, keep them separated. Don't let it get to this point. And then we can try to reintroduce them. But boy, that was bad.\"]\n",

just like you who sent it into this address right there which you of course can do as well and today we're gonna talk to Kinesha Kinesha what's it all about hi Jackson I'm Kinesha from the Cayman Islands my husband and I have a cat sunshine she's 11 years old and we've always wanted to get another cat to you know keep her company and also rescue from the human society but you know we're a bit worried because she has been the only cat in the home for so long in 11 years and we just wonder whether or not she'll be very receptive to the addition of another cat in the home we'd love your feedback on the best approach to do so you know what can we do to make this a seamless process because we'd really love for it to be a success and to avoid any elimination or scratching or you know any of the behaviors that are likely to be exhibited if she is unhappy with the addition of the new cat which she has done in the past in some instances when you know we have gone out and left her for too long so I'd really love to hear your thoughts on that thank you all right well first of all Kinesha right on I'm so glad that you're all about rescuing the cats in your area who need homes I mean that goes without saying and of course I want you to do that at the same time we do have to take care of what sunshine's needs are at this point and at 11 years old and from what I understand from what you said she's never been around another cat before you know that's that's something you really just need to consider a couple of things that I noticed in what you sent me was first of all this so clearly sunshine is still playful she likes to be a little mischievous and chase things under the sheets and whatnot and that tells us okay so she still has that get up and go at 11 years old is still let's just be very clear about this where she's technically a senior some cats are just more senior than others and some just retain that playfulness that inquisitiveness and it's important to know who sunshine is before we compliment her with someone that sunshine would like now there are a couple of different ways you can go you can adopt another senior and that believe me not just you Kinesha but everyone you guys seniors need homes so much quicker than other cats because the stress that they go through in rescue environments is multiplied because we know that as cats get older they manifest stress physically a lot quicker than younger cats so yeah man getting seniors out of out of rescue situations is paramount so I would definitely encourage that what I would encourage is a cat that maybe has been around other cats before so the adjustment for the newcomer isn't as bad as it could be and by that cat being somewhat relaxed perhaps sunshine will be as well the second way you can go now folks do this all the time they have older cats they are missing the concept of youthful energy and they go out and they adopt a kitten and they always say the same thing it's for the cat my cat needs a friend and let me tell you something your senior cat does not need a kitten no they do not need a kitten in their life they've got this they're settled they have their territory sort of buttoned down they know what every day is going to bring and all of a sudden Dennis the men is shows up with a slingshot and everything is just shot if you are thinking about bringing a kitten into a home with a cat like sunshine first of all remember something whether it's you Kanisha or anybody else it's for you it's not for sunshine sunshine could get used to it but it's because you want another cat in the house and Kanisha made that clear that this is more about what you guys would like so I like the fact that you're starting from there but I'm telling you this you guys if you're going to adopt a younger cat whether it's a kitten or a teenager anywhere in the first year of life adopt to just bring home to to is always better than one especially when it comes to kittens those guys will entertain each other they will learn the ropes they will play at their speed and sunshine then has that ability to watch them from a distance and figure out what this thing is all about and be able to join when she wants to and walk away when she wants to as well yeah every now and again the kittens will decide that sunshine's tail is the best toy in the whole wide world but you guys can deal with that as long as you let sunshine know that this is her place so she doesn't feel like she needs to claim it away from someone else then that's a great place to start so whether it's two kittens or one senior or anywhere in between I guess it's more about when you meet that cat how do you think they'll match up are you getting a cat who is just really really hyper and sunshine doesn't seem to be or are you getting someone who matches her energy level I think that that's really one of the the best things that you can do now whether again it's a kitten or a teenager or a senior or anywhere in between any cat that you go I think sunshine will be able to cope with this cat then it all comes down to the introduction process and and that to me is the most key element of making a resident cat happy who's not been around other cats her whole life just safe introductions if you check out my book Total Cat Mojo you'll see the entire introduction process laid out in exhaustive detail we've got videos about introducing cats so take a look at my videos there's a few I'll leave them in the description one you want to make sure that you establish a really good base camp for your newcomer so that's one video the second one would be about introducing cats don't skip the steps even if you go quickly through them because sunshine is like yeah none of this matters to me great but you might see that it does matter to her that she smells cats under the door and goes what's going on here and as long as you do it slowly and you don't threaten her well-being you know what you can bring cats into the house it's my belief that cats should be with other cats so whether you bring in a senior kinesha whether you bring in a couple of kittens not one but a couple of kittens there's a really good chance that you can make it work to your satisfaction and to sunshine satisfaction right sunshine right all right you guys keep those questions coming all you got to do is go to this link right down here and it will prompt you to basically do exactly what kinesha did so brilliantly which is to say your name your cat's name what your question is and then some footage of your cat doing anything in this case with sunshine just you know enjoying the Cayman Islands which I think any of us would do and this week's team cat Mojo Rockstar is Batman and now obviously the name Batman got me in the first place but Batman is just an expert fetcher let's take a look his person Lisa knows exactly how to toss it Batman knows exactly how to bring it back and everyone's happy except for this innocent bystander right here there's always the cat in the room was like you guys playing fetch again well I don't understand it this is so boring you throw you bring it back you throw you bring it back and I just have to sit here and watch it all day man anyway Batman's Rockstar and your other cat is great just because they provide such brilliant commentary again for your questions you go to Jackson Galaxy dot com forward slash submit for rock stars you do the exact same thing just make sure you're saying hey my cat's a rock star as opposed to hey I've got a question and then everything falls into place from there all right you guys stay safe out there show some love it doesn't take much and and it makes you feel better and it makes the world go around don't it all right light love and Mojo to you guys take care now\", \" What's up gang is I Jackson Galaxy your cat daddy and today your cat question answerer that is what I'm here for today hopefully we get

      "Agent Response: content=\"Hey there, Kinesha! It's great to hear that you're considering bringing another cat into your home to keep Sunshine company. It's wonderful that you're thinking of adopting from a shelter - that's a fantastic way to give a cat a second chance at a happy life.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about why cats scratch furniture. Scratching is a natural behavior for cats. It helps them stretch their muscles, sharpen their claws, and mark their territory with scent glands in their paws. So, when Sunshine scratches your furniture, she's not trying to be naughty - she's just following her instincts.\\n\\nTo prevent furniture scratching, you can provide alternative scratching surfaces for Sunshine. Invest in a sturdy scratching post made of materials like sisal or cardboard. Place the scratching post near her favorite furniture so she's more likely to use it.\\n\\nAnother tip is to make the furniture less appealing to scratch. You can do this by covering it with double-sided tape or using a citrus-scented spray, as most cats dislike these textures and smells.\\n\\nRemember, never punish Sunshine for scratching. Instead, positively reinforce her when she uses the scratching post by offering treats or praise.\\n\\nBy understanding and addressing Sunshine's scratching behavior, you can create a harmonious environment for her and any new feline friends you may bring into your home. Good luck, Kinesha, and enjoy the process of introducing Sunshine to her potential new companion!\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 286, 'prompt_tokens': 3363, 'total_tokens': 3649, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-d2a6e294-fb37-4e7f-b8b4-e3c748d841f4-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3363, 'output_tokens': 286, 'total_tokens': 3649, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"
